</div>

The DMS-UI is a React-based user interface designed to prop up browser-accessible data portals. Although the DMS-UI can be used for any web application, it is designed to integrate with Overture's Ego and Arranger microservices.

The DMS-UI is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

For more information about the DMS-UI, including setup and how to integrate Overture microservices Arranger and Ego, see our [official DMS-UI user documentation](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/dms-ui/)
