# Stage

Stage is a simple yet powerful React-based user interface framework designed to facilitate the creation of browser-accessible data portals. While versatile enough to be used for various web applications, Stage is specifically tailored for building the front-end of data management platforms. It provides a robust foundation for developers to rapidly construct and customize data-centric web interfaces.
