</div>

Stage is a React-based user interface designed to prop up browser-accessible data portals. Although Stage can be used for any web application, it is designed to integrate with Overture's Ego and Arranger microservices.

Stage is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

For more information about Stage, including setup and how to integrate Overture microservices Arranger and Ego, see our [official Stage user documentation](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/Stage/)
