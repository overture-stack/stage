# Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8.3.0 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v4.32.0 or higher)

## Developer Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a complete development environment, including Stage and its complementary services.

### Setting up supporting services

We'll use our Conductor service, a flexible Docker Compose setup, to spin up Stage's complementary services.

1. Clone the Conductor repository and move into its directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/overture-stack/conductor.git
   cd conductor
   ```

2. Run the appropriate start command for your operating system:

   | Operating System | Command             |
   | ---------------- | ------------------- |
   | Unix/macOS       | `make stageDev`     |
   | Windows          | `make.bat stageDev` |

    <details>
    <summary>**Click here for a detailed breakdown**</summary>

   This command will set up all complementary services for Stage development as follows:

   ![Stage Dev](./assets/stageDev.svg 'Stage Dev Environment')

   | Service         | Port   | Description                                     | Purpose in Stage Development                          |
   | --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
   | Conductor       | -      | Orchestrates deployments and environment setups | Manages the overall development environment           |
   | Keycloak        | `8080` | Authorization and authentication service        | Provides OAuth2 authentication for Stage              |
   | Arranger Server | `5050` | GraphQL API for data querying                   | Handles data queries for Stage's search functionality |
   | Elasticsearch   | `9200` | Search and analytics engine                     | Stores and indexes data for Arranger                  |

   - Ensure all ports are free on your system before starting the environment.
   - You may need to adjust the ports in the `docker-compose.yml` file if you have conflicts with existing services.

   For more information on configuring and using these services, see our [Conductor documentation](/docs/other-software/Conductor).

    </details>

In the next steps, we will run a Stage development server against these supporting services.

### Running the Development Server

1. Clone Stage and move into its directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/overture-stack/stage.git
   cd stage
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:

   ```bash
   mv .env.stage .env
   ```

    <details>
    <summary>**Click here for an explanation of key environment variables**</summary>

   ```env
   # Stage Variables
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LAB_NAME=Stage Development Environment
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=contact@overture.bio
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_MOBILE_WARNING=true

   # Keycloak Variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER=keycloak
   ACCESSTOKEN_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=super_secret
   SESSION_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=this_is_a_super_secret_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_HOST=http://keycloak:8080
   NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_REALM=myrealm
   NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=webclient
   KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=ikksyrYaKX07acf4hpGrpKWcUGaFkEdM
   NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_PERMISSION_AUDIENCE=dms

   # Arranger Variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_DOCUMENT_TYPE=file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_INDEX=file_centric
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_API_URL=http://arranger-server:5050
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_MANIFEST_COLUMNS=repositories.code, object_id, analysis.analysis_id, study_id, file_type, file.name, file.size, file.md5sum, file.index_file.object_id, donors.donor_id, donors.specimens.samples.sample_id
   ```

   - **Stage Variables**

   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Specifies the base URL for NextAuth.js, which handles authentication in Next.js applications. This setting is used to configure the authentication flow, including where to redirect users after successful authentication.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAB_NAME`: The name displayed in the top left of the portal interface. Feel free to customize this.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email address of the administrator or support contact. This setting updates the help link found by default in the footer navigation of the portal interface.

   - **Keycloak Variables**

   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER`: Specifies the authentication provider, in this case, "keycloak".
   - `ACCESSTOKEN_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`: Defines the secret used to encrypt access tokens, enhancing security by preventing easy decoding of intercepted tokens.
   - `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`: Specifies the secret used to encrypt session cookies, protecting sensitive information stored in the cookie from unauthorized access.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_HOST`: Specifies the URL where the Keycloak server is hosted (e.g., "http://localhost:8080").
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_REALM`: Defines the realm in Keycloak that contains the users and roles for the application.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for the Keycloak application.
   - `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for the Keycloak application.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_PERMISSION_AUDIENCE`: Specifies the audience for the permission claims in the access token, restricting the scope of access granted to the token.

   - **Arranger Variables**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_DOCUMENT_TYPE`: Specifies whether the index is file-centric or analysis (participant) centric.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_INDEX`: Defines the index used by the Arranger service.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_API_URL`: The URL of the Arranger GraphQL API. By default, Arranger's API is mapped to port 5050.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARRANGER_MANIFEST_COLUMNS`: Lists the columns to be included in the manifest generated for download with Score.

3. Install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

   :::tip
   Ensure you are running Node.js v16 or higher. To check, you can run `node --version`. You should see something similar to the following:

   ```bash
   v16.14.0
   ```

   :::

4. Start the Stage development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Verification

After installation and configuration, verify that Stage is functioning correctly:

1. **Check the Stage UI**

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser.
   - Expected result: You should see the Stage front-end UI.
   - Troubleshooting:
     - Check your browser's console for error messages.
     - Verify that you're using the correct URL.

2. **Test Login Functionality**

   - Use the default Keycloak credentials:

     | Field    | Value      |
     | -------- | ---------- |
     | Username | `admin`    |
     | Password | `admin123` |

   - Expected result: You should be able to log in and access the Stage dashboard.
   - Troubleshooting:
     - Ensure Keycloak is running and configured correctly.
     - Check the Stage server logs for authentication-related errors.

3. **Test API Key Functionality**
   - From the top right dropdown, select "Profile".
   - On the profile page, select "Generate API Key".
   - Expected result: A new API key should be generated and displayed on the screen.
